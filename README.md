This is a little project to study APIs RESTfull using simple CRUD, MONGODB, MVC and the design pattern Factory.

Yes, it's using the framework Expressjs.

It's doing use of PUG as template engine to the HTML, but you can use anyone or no template engine, because the main goal is data in JSON. And, the 
Views is there just to complement the studies.

Sorry by the user guide, it does not exists yet, but it will...

This project is also to pratice my english, because it's rust as you can see xD
